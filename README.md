# Brainwave_Matrix_Text_to_Image_Generation
# Text to Image Project

This project is a **Text-to-Image** generation model that allows users to convert a textual description into a generated image using advanced machine learning techniques and AI models. It is built to demonstrate the capabilities of neural networks for image generation from textual prompts.

## Features
- **Text Input**: Users can provide a textual description (e.g., "A sunset over a mountain").
- **Image Generation**: The system generates an image based on the provided description.
- **Multiple Image Output**: Generates multiple variations of the same prompt, providing users with diverse options.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For backend processing and AI model usage.
- **OpenAI's DALL·E or similar AI Model**: For generating images from text prompts.
- **Flask/Django (Optional)**: For creating a web interface to interact with the model.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For running the machine learning models.
  
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Access to a machine with GPU (Optional for faster generation)

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-image.git
    cd text-to-image
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration
- Set up your OpenAI API keys (or any other image generation model API you're using) in `config.py` or as environment variables.

### Running the Project
1. Run the Python script for generating images:
    ```bash
    python generate_image.py --text "A sunset over a mountain"
    ```

2. (Optional) Run the web interface:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to interact with the web interface.

### Example
For the prompt "A sunset over a mountain," the model will generate an image reflecting the description provided.
